# Gensou Framework

## Project Overview
  
Gensou Visual Novel Framework is a lightweight, simple, and open-source framework designed for creating visual novel prototypes. It supports both Unity and Godot, enabling users to quickly build and expand upon their own visual novel projects.

The framework features its own scripting language, Genscript, which is easy to learn and designed specifically for non-programmers. With Genscript, users can easily create narrative dialogues and control the flow of the game.

Gensou now supports both C# and GDScript to cater to different user preferences and development needs.

## Development Roadmap

Here’s the current development roadmap, sorted by priority:

- [x] Basic Genscript commands
- [x] UI Manager
- [x] Save/Load system
- [x] Audio Control
- [ ] Writing dialogues
- [ ] Creating branching story options
- [ ] Switching character portraits and backgrounds
- [ ] Predefined UI templates

Once the above features are completed, no new features will be added, but maintenance will continue.
