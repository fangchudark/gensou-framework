# Comments
  
## Overview  
  
Comments, as the name suggests, allow developers to understand the purpose of the code, making future maintenance and comprehension easier.

## Syntax
  
- **;**  
  
## Details
  
### **;**

Using this symbol, all characters following it on the same line will be ignored as comments.

```gs
-a=10; Declare a variable a; this is a comment, and this line will not affect the actual code.
; Comments can also occupy a line on their own without any code.
This line is an incorrect example, as it lacks a comment symbol and will be recognized as dialogue text.
